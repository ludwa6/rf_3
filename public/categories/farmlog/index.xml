      <description>Beautiful time of year here, in this landscape so liberally sprinkled with almond flowers -introduced as a form of artificial snow, according to legend. Beautiful, but also challenging, in that Good Stewardship of these trees and the soil in which they grown involves a lot of work that needs doing in this short winter season, when days are short and weather unpredictable.
SO: There&amp;rsquo;s a lot going on! And not much time for squinting and pecking at the computer screen&amp;hellip;</description>
