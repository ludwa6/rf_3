Though the concept of "Slow Food" was a thing some time ago -today, maybe not so much- the SLO (Seasonal/ Local/ Organic) food movement here in Lagos is really gaining traction, as locals are coming to understand what it means and appreciate the many benefits.

As we are challenged by the growing number of discriminating consumers to explain _exactly what this means to us_ at Quinta Vale da Lama, and _what we are doing about it_, we are elevating core principles to the level of policy:

- **Seasonal**: Meals & menus on the farm are based on _what's coming out of our fields this week_, and eat what's out-of-season only in the form of preserves.
- **Local**: We give affirmative action for the most local sources, i.e.
  - 1st choice: our own production
  - 2nd choice: what's produced on neighboring farms
  - 3rd choice: "imports" that are otherwise consistent with our Ethics
- **Organic**: We abide by standards required for Bio certification, and beyond...
  - avoidance of noxious chemicals and GMO's (the minimum required for "Bio" certification), and moreover...
  - building soil fertility as described in [the "REAL Organic" standard](https://www.refarmer.net/post/real-organic-standards/) to grow the tastiest & most nutrient-dense food that is truly "Beyond BIO"
